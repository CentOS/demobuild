# Contributions

Want to help contribute to the DemoBuilder? Got a demo of your own you'd like to add?


## Quick Contributions

We don't claim to be 100% typo free, and occasionally we don't use the best methods in our scripting. If you spot a typo or a quick script cleanup that would help, it is absolutely worth a pull request. Having another set of eyes to catch our mistakes makes the project and resulting demos that much better, so thank you.

## Feature Contributions

If you'd like to contribute a new demo, there are a few basic guidelines we ask that you follow:

* Fork the repository and make your changes on a fork in a feature branch

Your feature branch should be named for the project you're adding. If the demo or feature is version-specific, then please include the version too. Example: ```RDO-mitaka-update_install_scripts``` or ```Gluster-add-failover-support```

* All contributions must include current documentation.

This helps improve the overall quality of the projects, as well as helping those running the demos to know what may or may not be important to talk about.

* Pull requests merge cleanly on top of master.


## Found a bug?

### Is it ours?
There are probably a few running around, but we need to make sure they're filed where they'll do the most good.

If you find a bug specific to the DemoBuilder, then by all means please file it in our [issues](https://github.com/CentOS/demobuild/issues) section and we'll get to it as soon as we can. We'll need to know a few things first though:

* Full description of the bug
* Details on how to reproduce it
* What you expected to happen
* What actually happened


### Is it a project bug?

Because we're automating the installation and setup for a number of other projects, it's possible that you may uncover a bug in one of the demo projects. In this case it's generally best to file the bug 'upstream' with that project. This way it can be resolved and addressed sooner, by the appropriate people.



### Not sure?

If you're honestly not sure if the bug belongs to us or one of the partner projects, go ahead and file it with us, but we if it turns out to be a project bug, we'll likely ask you to re-file it with them in their bug tracker.
